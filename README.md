## Code

The Create React App layout gives you a lot of the starting template for creating your own react site. By adding all of my style links in my index.html file (bootstrap, google fonts, animate, etc). It will utilize these in all of the rest of the code.

I then created all of the components that I needed to make the site (CharCard, Header, Title, Nav, and Wrapper). In each of these components, I made individual javascript and css files. Then, in the App.js file, I created the code for the actual functionality of the game and the layout for the page. I called each compnent in the App.js to render the page.
